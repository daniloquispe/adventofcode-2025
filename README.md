# Advent of Code 2025

Here are the full solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a
variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like (in my case, I will use PHP). People use
them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge 
each other. You can get more info about Advent of code 2025 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about).

Starting this year (2025), there will be 12 days of puzzles each December.

## About the puzzle solutions

Each daily solution is a set of PHP files inside a `day-XX` directory (with `XX` from 01 to 12). Each directory has a
`puzzle.md` file with the puzzle description (from Advent of Code website) and a `solution.php` file with the solution.

You can run any solution file via PHP CLI (no web browser needed), for example:

```shell
/usr/bin/php ./day-01/solution.php
```

To keep solutions as simple as possible, no 3rd-party libraries are used.
