# Advent of Code 2025

Here are my full solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles.

## What is Advent of Code?

From the official website:

> Advent of Code is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a
variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use
them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge 
each other. You can get more info about Advent of code 2025 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about).

Starting this year (2025), there will be 12 days of puzzles each December.

## About the puzzle solutions

My intention is to use [PHP](https://www.php.net/) to solve all the puzzles.

Each daily solution is a set of PHP files inside a `day-XX` directory (with `XX` from 01 to 12). Each directory has a
`puzzle.md` file with the puzzle description (from Advent of Code website) and two PHP files with names `solution-1.php`
and `solution-2.php` for both parts 1 and 2 of the puzzle.

You can run any solution file via **PHP CLI** (no web browser needed), for example:

```shell
/usr/bin/php ./day-01/solution-2.php
```

To keep solutions as simple as possible, no third-party libraries are used.

## Setup

* **PHP version:** 8.5.0
* **OS:** [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/) with [GNOME desktop](https://www.gnome.org/)
* **IDE:** [PhpStorm 2025-2.5](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)

IDE and AI features (such as autocomplete or code snippets suggest) are used only for coding/typing speed purposes. No
AI-generated code was used in any of the solutions.
